      <h1> What is RPL Rivet? </h1>
      <p>
        RPL Rivet is a program designed to protect CSV files from being
        misinterpreted when imported into Excel or other spreadsheet programs.
      </p>
      <h1> Why is RPL Rivet needed? </h1>
      <p>
        Well, you know how scientists are renaming human genes to prevent them from being
        misinterpreted by Excel? Yeah, that's why.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a CSV file is opened into Excel, Excel makes some assumptions about the
        data inside it. For example, if Excel sees "APR7" in the CSV file, it will
        assume that data is a date and display it as "7-Apr", changing the data inside
        the cell to a date.
        a date.

      <h1> What is Rosie Pattern Language (RPL)? </h1>
      <p>
        The Rosie Pattern Language is like regular expressions, but it runs faster and uses less
        space to do so. It is intended to replace regular expressions in scenarios where many regex
        are used, many people are using regex, or regex is being used at a production level. Rosie
        is more powerful than regex, and it runs significantly faster on big data, which we
        anticipate many of our users will be working with.

        We use this language (something showing how we use RPL specificially for our proj)
